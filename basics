selector {
  property : value;
  }
common text properties ~ text-align, font-weight, line-height, text-decoration, letter-spacing
font-size
Universal selector (select everything) *
ID selector - unique identifier (used only once with the same name)
#idname {
  property : value;
  }

Class selectors (class - group together the content in a web page)
The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents of their class attribute.

Descendant Selector - select all <a>'s that are nested inside an <li>
li a {
  color : teal;
  }
Adjacent selector - select only paragraphs that are immediately preceeded by an <h1>
h2 + p {
  color : red;
  }

Direct Child 
select only the <li>'s that are direct children of a <div> element.
div > li {
  color : white;
  }
Attribute selector - select all input elements with a particular attribute

Pseudo-classes
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). 
For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.
/* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */
button:hover {
  color: blue;
}

Pseudo-elements
A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). 
For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.
/* The first line of every <p> element. */
p::first-line {
  color: blue;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
Cascading - order matters!

Specificity - Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. 
Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors.
id > class > element

border - box-sizing: border-box (to fit in the box only)
padding - spacing bw the actual content and the border of the box element
margin - spacing outside bw border and other elements
opacity
The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. 
Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.
z-index
The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex items. 
Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.

float
The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. 
The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).

overflow
The overflow CSS shorthand property sets the desired behavior for an element's overflow — 
i.e. when an element's content is too big to fit in its block formatting context — in both directions.

box-shadow
The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. 
A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.
